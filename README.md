Portfolio site

This is the work-in-progress version of my portfolio originally hosted at https://matthewchristopherjones.com/

Within, you'll find a curated selection of my works across filmmaking, cinematography, graphic design, animation, and now, web design and development.

I'm currently reworking my stack, and developing a working version of my blog written in NodeJS insted of PHP. As a result, the blog section of this site isn't working as of 12/2.

Thanks for stopping by!
